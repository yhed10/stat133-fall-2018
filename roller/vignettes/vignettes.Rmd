## Rolling a object

The package `"roller"` is a minimal implementation for simulating rolling a object a given number of times, and to visualize the relative frequencies in such a series of rolling.

The first step is to create a `"fair_coin"`

##Creating a object
```{r}
fair_coin <- device()
fair_coin
```

By default, `device()` creates a _fair_ coin with standard sides `1`, and `2`, and with probability values for each side of 0.5


##Checking class
```{r}
is.device(fair_coin)
```

We can check the class of fair_coin. If it is class of device, then output comes with TRUE, if not FALSE

```{r}
fair_die <- device(sides = 1:6, prob = rep(1/6, 6))
```

We also can make 6 sides of fair dice

##Object "rolls"
```{r}
fair_die <- device() 
set.seed(123)
fair50 <- roll(fair_die, times = 50) 
fair50
```

When we use `roll()`, we can create list of sides, prob, and total number of times. 

## Summary method for object "rolls"

```{r}
set.seed(123)
fair_50rolls <- roll(fair_die, times = 50) 
fair50_sum <- summary(fair_50rolls)
fair50_sum
```
We can make summary with count, sides, and probablilty using summary.
The result output with data.frame

## Plot methd for object "rolls"

```{r}
plot(fair_50rolls)
```

We can make barplot using plot()


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
